# Neural-Chess
Group 5's submission for Dr. King's PHYS 3330 at UTD. Keras based neural chess evaluator. Highly based on Erik Bernhardsson's Deep Pink, see [here](https://erikbern.com/2014/11/29/deep-learning-for-chess). This code is hardcoded in places, so keep that in mind while reviewing.

Training data compiled, cleaned, and transformed into keras-friendly format by 9K, along with the neural network coding and training. Play algorithms by Patrick Ralston and John Thai.
